// Multithreading in java
Multithreading is one of the most popular feature of Java programming language as it allows the concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program. 
Concurrent execution means two or more parts of the program are executing at the same time, this maximizes the CPU utilization and gives you better performance. 
These parts of the program are called threads.

Threads are independent because they all have separate path of execution that’s the reason if an exception occurs in one thread, it doesn’t affect the execution of other threads. 
All threads of a process share the common memory. The process of executing multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading.

// Advantages of Multithreading
Efficient CPU Utilization: As more than one threads run independently, this allows the CPU to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
Improved Performance
Better Resource Sharing: As discussed earlier, threads share common memory, this reduces overhead compared to processes.
